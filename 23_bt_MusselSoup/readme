Bootstrap lets you make fancy components such as carousels and dropdown menus. They have many built in classes like col align-self-center, 
which automatically moves the column to the center. 
When making a carousel, the caption is put on the images by default.
Our default carousel filled the entire screen, we had to add mx-auto to the class to center it.
When making our accordion, Bootstrap has a pre-made id called "accordionPanelsStayOpenExample" which keeps the accordion open all times..
