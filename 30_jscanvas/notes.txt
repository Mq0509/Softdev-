       HTML file for JavaScript canvas work
    QCC
    Why does only drawRect run in the code above, even when the console prints circ?
    The first click never draws anything.

    var draw = function(e) {
        //var draw = (e) => {
        console.log("AJAJ")
        if(mode == "rect"){
            console.log("rec")
            c.addEventListener("click",drawRect);
            drawRect;
        }
        else{
            console.log("circ")
            c.addEventListener("click",drawCircle);
            drawCircle;
        }
    }
