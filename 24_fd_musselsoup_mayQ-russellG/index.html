      <td>Bob 3.0 and Bob are siblings. Bob 3.0 is mad at Bob for having the superior name without a number. Bob tells Bob 3.0, "TOO BAD!, I am the original Bob
        I should be mad at you for taking my name." Furious, Bob 3.0 goes to Bob and plucks off his ears. Bob screams in pain and takes revenge. Now, Bob 3.0 is scared, 
        and fled. He now stays in Russell's room all day, afraid to leave the safe place.

        <td>Bob 3.0 is really sad that he now has to stay home all day in hopes of hiding from Bob. Sitting home all day, he reflected on his life. He realized that he should not 
          have been so violent and mean to Bob. Now, because of his actions to Bob, police from all over the city are looking for him with a bounty of 3 million dollars. Thankfully 
          he has his dumb friend Russell who is willing to risk going to jail just to help him hide. Without Russell, he would be on the streets.

        <td> Bob 3.0 learned that Russell often gets paired with students in Softdev. Tremoring, Bob 3.0 asks,"Russel, who is your teammate?" Bewildered, Russell responds, "May, why what about
          it?" Bob 3.0's stomach plummeted. He felt like his life was over. Sobbing, Bob 3.0 wonders,"Should I just give myself in to the police? MAY IS BOB'S OWNER AHAHAHAHHAHA." With his last
          bit of hope, he asks Russell,"Have you mentioned me anytime?" Russell answers, "yeah of course. Duckies are our family."

        <td> Being the awesome ducky owner May is, May immediately tells Bob about her discovery of the location of Bob 3.0. Afterall, getting both ears chopped off wasn't something that could 
          be forgiven. Bob quickly calls the police, forgetting he was not longer able to hear. May helps him, telling the police the location of Bob 3.0. Just like that, Russell and Bob 3.0 will
          both be getting 5 years in jail.
